Project 2
=========
The request:
_The following code in C language contains some vulnerabilities. Analyze the code, report in the code as comments the vulnerabilities you have found and explain why these are vulnerabilities._

I am not C developer as I`ve pointed out during our interview And whenever I saw this code I remembered what headache caused  
when I had to work with  pointer arithmetic. That's probably reason I became a Java developer :-)

So I`ve spotted several obvious issues of the code 
however I have never been feeling like C expert and probably there are more issues.

I decided to provide my comments in the form of pull request which I consider easy readable for people from IT:
